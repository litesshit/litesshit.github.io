WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
Hey, Lee! Got another shipment?

00:10.320 --> 00:14.540
You bet. The best candy mushrooms I know how to nurture.

00:17.300 --> 00:20.260
Your supplies. Thanks again for the trade, Lee.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.860
Sure you don't want to come with us? Meet some people, maybe?

00:28.340 --> 00:29.860
Seems pretty lonely out here.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.760
I don't mind being alone. I'm my own best friend.

01:00.000 --> 01:18.760
Awesome. Sounds like new neighbors. It's been a while.

01:18.760 --> 01:25.520
Welcome, friends. Welcome to the land of Lee!

01:25.520 --> 01:46.280
That portal must have messed me up.

01:46.280 --> 01:50.620
I'm seeing double. Triple. Stival?

01:51.040 --> 01:53.600
Follow my lead, no matter how weird it gets.

01:53.820 --> 01:58.320
Hi, everybody. I'm Lee. And who are those guys?

01:58.740 --> 02:02.500
That's also me. I'm here. And here. And here.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.700
I'm all over the place.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.460
You're all clones?

02:06.460 --> 02:09.460
Nope. Lee is just Lee.

02:09.460 --> 02:13.220
I'm one person who happens to have more than one body.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.220
I'm constantly multitasking.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.220
But enough about Lee. Who are you?

02:20.220 --> 02:24.220
Probably four separate individuals with your own ideas and dreams, am I right?

02:24.220 --> 02:25.980
Yeah. We're ninja-

02:25.980 --> 02:29.980
Min-compoops. For not introducing ourselves sooner.

02:29.980 --> 02:34.980
I'm Doyle Domegar. And this is my little sister, um, Fyldwire.

02:34.980 --> 02:41.980
Huh? Oh, yes! That is exactly my name. Fyldwire.

02:41.980 --> 02:49.740
It is a normal name, and I was given it at birth, so I have had it my whole life.

02:49.740 --> 02:53.740
Nice to meet you, Fyldwire.

02:53.740 --> 03:00.740
Name Strong McCool Guy. This is my wife, whose name, uh, I've forgotten.

03:00.740 --> 03:06.740
Sorry, he's kidding. My husband has an awful sense of humor. Just awful.

03:06.740 --> 03:10.740
My name is Maya. Maya McCool Guy.

03:10.740 --> 03:14.700
I love new people. Nice to meet you, Mrs. McCool Guy.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.500
Mr. McCool Guy?

03:16.500 --> 03:19.500
It's Count McCool Guy, actually.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
Oh. Pardon me, your Count-ship.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.500
Pardon granted.

03:25.500 --> 03:30.500
But what happened to us? The last thing I remember, there was a big rip in the sky.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.500
Then everything went dark and we woke up here.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.500
Don't freak out, okay?

03:35.500 --> 03:40.500
But the bad news is a while back, every single realm was suddenly destroyed.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.460
In an event called The Merge.

03:42.460 --> 03:43.460
That's no wonder-

03:43.460 --> 03:44.460
Wow!

03:44.460 --> 03:47.260
Total bummer to hear, Lee.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.260
I know, right?

03:49.260 --> 03:51.260
But don't you fret.

03:51.260 --> 03:52.260
There's good news.

03:52.260 --> 03:57.460
You all must have been pushed into what's called an interstitial space bubble.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.460
It kept you safe.

03:58.460 --> 04:04.420
Lots of non-lees have returned from space bubbles, so you'll have many people to hang out with

04:04.420 --> 04:07.220
and will never, ever be lonely.

04:07.220 --> 04:10.220
Uh, what people?

04:10.220 --> 04:12.420
You don't mean...

04:12.420 --> 04:14.420
Let me show you.

04:14.420 --> 04:29.380
So, everyone lives in, what, an underground bunker of some kind?

04:29.380 --> 04:30.380
Yeah.

04:30.380 --> 04:32.380
The fun kind.

04:32.380 --> 04:40.340
All this is down here?

04:40.340 --> 04:42.340
Who knew?

04:42.340 --> 04:44.340
I built it myself.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.340
The hardest part was the mechanical sun.

04:46.340 --> 04:49.340
On the surface, it can be pretty dreary.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.340
But it's always sunny down here.

04:51.340 --> 05:16.300
On the surface, it's always sunny down here.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.300
Friends, an announcement.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.300
The community of Lee has some new neighbors.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.300
And you know what that means.

05:23.300 --> 05:27.300
New neighbor for New Kansas!

05:27.300 --> 05:29.300
Yeah!

05:29.300 --> 05:31.300
Buckle up.

05:31.300 --> 05:43.300
Perhaps you feel down in the dumps, all realms destroyed, you've hit a slump.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.300
But cheer up.

05:46.300 --> 05:51.300
One haven still has one.

05:51.300 --> 06:00.300
A land where every moment's filled with fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.300
In the land of Lee, we got friends galore.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.300
And no one's ever lonely or sad.

06:06.300 --> 06:09.300
In the land of Lee, many caverns to explore.

06:09.300 --> 06:12.300
Just tap and swipe and see on my fancy coffee bag.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.300
I'll be back.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.300
Slide into cavern five, where waters flow.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.300
And race in cavern eight, on your mark, set go.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.300
The thrills of cavern twelve, you can't resist.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.300
Seventeen theme parks.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.300
Can you handle this?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.300
Your friends and family might reemerge.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.300
From super spacey bubble powered by a cosmic surge.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.300
But even air, they never do.

06:28.300 --> 06:34.300
A jet pack race is waiting just for you.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.300
Our fake sky gleams so bright.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.300
Endless sunshine day and night.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.300
Get your shades.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.300
Mech dragon rides are free.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.300
We have no money.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.300
Fund's our only currency.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.300
There's a bank.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.300
Mail arrived before it's sent.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.300
Oh, wrong.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.300
Melody's so elegant.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.300
Oh, wrong.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.300
Oh, wrong.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.300
Melody's so elegant.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.300
Oh, lovely.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.300
Every beat's a perfect night.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.300
And don't forget our lyrics always.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
A jet pack race is waiting just for you.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.300
Our fake sky gleams so bright.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.300
Happy day.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.300
Endless sunshine day and night.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.300
Get your shades.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.300
Mech dragon rides are free.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.300
We have no money.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.300
Fund's our only currency.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.300
There's a bank.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.300
Mail arrived before it's sent.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.300
Oh, wrong.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.300
Melody's so elegant.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.300
Oh, lovely.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.300
Every beat's a perfect night.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.300
Oh, wrong.

07:11.300 --> 07:18.300
And don't forget our lyrics always, always, always.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.300
Um, rhyme.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.300
Rhyme.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.300
Rhyme.

07:24.300 --> 07:29.300
In the land of Lee, all you want is free.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.300
Stay and play in our ice cream hotels.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.300
Rhyme.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.300
Down in the land of Lee.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.300
Playgrounds under the sea.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.300
Hear this lead totally rock out on the bells.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.300
The air outside will make you sick.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.300
Threats are short, I report.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.300
And the haze is crazy thick.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.300
Why wander out when your friends are near?

07:53.300 --> 07:56.300
Guess inside, bonafide stand-up comics bring the cheer.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.300
Why is he doing this?

07:58.300 --> 07:59.300
What's the deal with the merge?

07:59.300 --> 08:00.300
Am I right?

08:00.300 --> 08:02.300
Uh, cause his vibe is fierce.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.300
No.

08:03.300 --> 08:08.300
Why is Lee lying and saying the merge destroyed the realms and made the air toxic?

08:08.300 --> 08:11.300
Guess he's just trying to keep these people here for some reason.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.300
Time for the lake!

08:13.300 --> 08:14.300
Dude!

08:14.300 --> 08:16.300
This is my life!

08:16.300 --> 08:18.300
Over here we go!

08:18.300 --> 08:22.300
In the land of Lee, look around and see.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.300
All your happiness can be found.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.300
Happiness can be found.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.300
Where did ya go?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.300
Through way, way underground.

08:30.300 --> 08:35.300
In the land of me, take a good look around

08:35.300 --> 08:38.300
In the land of me, at my glorious town

08:38.300 --> 08:42.300
Cause your heart will resound, with the happiest sound

08:42.300 --> 08:45.300
Every joy will abound, when you fall underground

08:45.300 --> 08:48.300
In the land of me

08:48.300 --> 08:51.300
With me, and me, and me, and me

08:51.300 --> 08:55.300
Cause me, me, and me, me, make me

08:55.300 --> 09:10.300
Um, thanks for having us?

09:10.300 --> 09:14.300
They loved it! The new neighbors loved it!

09:14.300 --> 09:16.300
I knew they would!

09:19.300 --> 09:22.300
You did tell us this place was weird

09:25.300 --> 09:30.300
Ouch!

09:30.300 --> 09:32.300
Ooh, I think someone could use a teacher

09:32.300 --> 09:34.300
What about two teachers?

09:34.300 --> 09:37.300
Good, your skills are improving, Ryu

09:37.300 --> 09:40.300
Now try Spinjitzu

09:40.300 --> 09:42.300
Remember, focus on your target

09:42.300 --> 09:44.300
You got this, Frack

09:55.300 --> 10:01.300
What? All this damage!

10:01.300 --> 10:03.300
Apologies, Mr. Frohicke

10:03.300 --> 10:04.300
We were just trying to train

10:04.300 --> 10:07.300
As the official assistant keeper of the monastery

10:07.300 --> 10:11.300
I insist you get out, so I can fix all this

10:11.300 --> 10:13.300
But to train Frack, we need to

10:13.300 --> 10:16.300
Find some place else to go!

10:16.300 --> 10:18.300
Come on, guys

10:18.300 --> 10:20.300
Let's go to the land of lost things

10:20.300 --> 10:21.300
Plenty of room there

10:21.300 --> 10:23.300
Plus, Geo's learning to bake

10:23.300 --> 10:25.300
So, there might be some practice cakes laying around

10:25.300 --> 10:29.300
Hmm, to not upset the bossy frogman

10:29.300 --> 10:31.300
We must continue elsewhere

10:35.300 --> 10:38.300
Yes, a junkyard might work

10:38.300 --> 10:40.300
Can you lead us there?

10:46.300 --> 10:49.300
Never thought I'd like a lava-less cave

10:49.300 --> 10:51.300
But this one's not bad

10:51.300 --> 10:53.300
The whole vibe weirds me out

10:53.300 --> 10:57.300
I can't believe Lee just gave us this starter home

10:57.300 --> 11:00.300
We can't all live in ancient monasteries

11:00.300 --> 11:02.300
I mean, what's up with that anyway?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.300
If it's a monastery, where are all the monks?

11:04.300 --> 11:05.300
Are you the monks?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.300
Welcome, new neighbors!

11:10.300 --> 11:13.300
My arm's getting tired from waving at everyone who waves to us

11:13.300 --> 11:15.300
Why are they so happy?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.300
Does Lee have the mind controlled?

11:17.300 --> 11:19.300
Nope

11:19.300 --> 11:20.300
How do you know?

11:20.300 --> 11:23.300
Back at the administration, we thought all this happiness was strange too

11:23.300 --> 11:26.300
So we secretly scanned for unlicensed mind control tech

11:26.300 --> 11:27.300
Nothing!

11:27.300 --> 11:28.300
No magical manipulation

11:28.300 --> 11:29.300
No spirit possession

11:29.300 --> 11:32.300
Nothing strange being chemically added to the air, water, or food

11:32.300 --> 11:34.300
So why is everyone like this?

11:34.300 --> 11:38.300
As far as we can tell, everyone here is happy because they actually like it here

11:38.300 --> 11:41.300
So the administration left Lee and the people down here alone

11:41.300 --> 11:44.300
But the neighbors think they can't leave

11:44.300 --> 11:47.300
Lee's happy little community is built on lies

11:47.300 --> 11:51.300
The administration isn't a police force, they're a bureaucracy

11:51.300 --> 11:54.300
Lying doesn't require a license or a permit, so they don't care

11:54.300 --> 11:57.300
In fact, they lie too

11:57.300 --> 11:58.300
Tons

11:58.300 --> 12:04.300
Uh, let's focus on the mission

12:04.300 --> 12:05.300
Aaron's mom and dad

12:05.300 --> 12:10.300
If they've been told there's no world outside, that would explain why they never came looking for Aaron

12:10.300 --> 12:12.300
Why don't we just ask Lee where they are?

12:12.300 --> 12:14.300
He seems friendly enough

12:14.300 --> 12:19.300
That idea wins the stupid award for stupidest idea ever to stupid

12:19.300 --> 12:22.300
Okay, Count McCool Guy

12:22.300 --> 12:26.300
If Lee figures out we're not who we say we are, he'll boot us right out

12:26.300 --> 12:30.300
If we're gonna find Aaron's parents, Lee can't know about it

12:30.300 --> 12:34.300
So, we act like good neighbors, split up and do some community events

12:34.300 --> 12:36.300
Ask questions on the sly

12:36.300 --> 12:39.300
Just call me Sly Fire

12:39.300 --> 12:46.300
Better

12:46.300 --> 12:49.300
Spenjutsu is half mental

12:49.300 --> 12:52.300
Feel it in your body and your mind

13:02.300 --> 13:05.300
Ryu, who did you say owned this junkyard?

13:05.300 --> 13:08.300
Because they might not be too happy with us

13:08.300 --> 13:12.300
Hi, uh, neighbors

13:12.300 --> 13:15.300
I heard that the local book club meets here

13:15.300 --> 13:17.300
Yeah, Peroni

13:17.300 --> 13:18.300
Doyle, right?

13:18.300 --> 13:21.300
Join what promises to be a lively discussion

13:21.300 --> 13:23.300
Oh, thank you

13:23.300 --> 13:26.300
My friends Jenny and Barry love to read

13:26.300 --> 13:29.300
I wonder if they're members of the club

13:29.300 --> 13:32.300
Please hold all other topics until later

13:32.300 --> 13:33.300
Thank you so much

13:33.300 --> 13:36.300
We're really jazzed to discuss this week's book now

13:38.300 --> 13:40.300
Between you and Lee?

13:40.300 --> 13:43.300
The official autobiography of Lee

13:43.300 --> 13:44.300
Spoiler

13:44.300 --> 13:46.300
It's really Lee-rific

13:46.300 --> 13:48.300
Counterpoint

13:48.300 --> 13:50.300
It's double Lee-rific

13:50.300 --> 13:53.300
Hmm, you've convinced me

13:53.300 --> 13:54.300
Let's discuss

13:54.300 --> 14:01.300
So, my thoughts is that, you know, this book could use a little bit more Lee in this book

14:01.300 --> 14:07.300
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

14:08.300 --> 14:09.300
Hello, neighbor

14:09.300 --> 14:11.300
Welcome to the parpar-par-tay

14:11.300 --> 14:12.300
What's your name?

14:12.300 --> 14:13.300
I can't remember

14:13.300 --> 14:14.300
Something dumb

14:14.300 --> 14:16.300
Is it your birthday or something?

14:16.300 --> 14:22.100
Oh, I wish. Lee gives everyone free shoulder rubs on their birthday.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.300
So why the party?

14:23.300 --> 14:27.300
It's for how great life is. Isn't life great? It's great.

14:27.300 --> 14:34.300
Sure, sure. But you know who loves parties? That couple, Jenny and Barry. Seen them around?

14:34.300 --> 14:39.300
Never heard of them, but they sound awesome. Why are you looking for them?

14:39.300 --> 14:44.300
What? Who's looking for them? I'm just being sly in a way that doesn't draw attention to myself.

14:44.300 --> 14:49.300
Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Well, in that case, I've got a question for you.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.300
How low can you go?

14:54.300 --> 14:57.300
Not even a challenge. Lower.

14:58.300 --> 15:01.300
I said lower.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.300
No one could go that low.

15:14.300 --> 15:21.300
Hey, you! Not impressed with my moves?

15:21.300 --> 15:29.300
What? Oh, no. It's not you. I can tell based on how you're acting. You're not like everyone else here.

15:29.300 --> 15:37.300
What? I totally am. Wildfire is my real name. Dang it. I mean Filedwire. Filedwire.

15:38.300 --> 15:47.300
Well, Filedwire. Something tells me you also think it's weird. Everyone's fine to just party on and accept what Lee's telling us. But, but...

15:47.300 --> 15:52.300
It's okay. You're right. I've been thinking the same thing.

15:53.300 --> 16:00.300
I might have proof that Lee's version of what happened with the merge is a big lie. Can you meet me later?

16:00.300 --> 16:09.300
Lloyd, being the slyest clue finder ever, I got something.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.300
About Aaron's parents?

16:10.300 --> 16:19.300
Not really, but maybe. I found a neighbor who has some ideas about what's really going on down here. And he's ready to expose Lee's secrets.

16:19.300 --> 16:24.300
This is where he said to meet.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.300
Lee!

16:33.300 --> 16:38.300
That's my name! Isn't it a delight to say. Just rolls off the tongue.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.300
Uh, didn't know this was your house.

16:42.300 --> 16:46.300
It's not. Just getting it ready for its next tenant.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.300
What happened to the old tenant?

16:49.300 --> 16:50.300
Move to Cavern 5.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.300
Huge water slide fan.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.300
Everyone's free to move around wherever they want.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.300
I see. Well, we won't keep you.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.300
The guy that lived here was gonna blow the whistle on Lee.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.300
And Lee just made him disappear.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.300
Lee needs the neighbors to not ask certain questions. But why?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.300
Look!

17:27.300 --> 17:29.300
Why are you snooping around here? Keep your voice down!

17:30.300 --> 17:35.300
Lee has ears everywhere. You two are new, so you probably aren't working for him.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
Who are you?

17:37.300 --> 17:56.300
Who I am isn't important. What I am is a former journalist. I woke up in the land of Lee about a year ago, so I figured I'd set up my own community newspaper. At first, Lee was supportive. But once I started digging into his story, I found inconsistencies.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.300
Go on.

17:59.300 --> 18:04.300
What if the world wasn't really destroyed? How do we know it's not still out there?

18:05.300 --> 18:10.300
I was supposed to get more info from the neighbor who lived here, but now he's gone missing.

18:10.300 --> 18:18.300
The world is still there. We're ninja from the outside. We're undercover here to find two people.

18:19.300 --> 18:26.300
I'll help you find your people if you'll help me tell everyone the truth about the outside. Deal?

18:29.300 --> 18:33.300
Then follow me. There's something you need to see.

18:33.300 --> 18:37.300
Hey! My junkyard!

18:39.300 --> 18:40.300
Who did this?

18:44.300 --> 18:46.300
Ryu. Who's this big jerk?

18:47.300 --> 18:55.300
Junkyard owner Creel. I am Ryu's teacher, Master Rontu. My student and I are responsible for the condition of your yard.

18:55.300 --> 19:04.300
Hmm. Well, I was hired to demolish all that junk. I just hadn't gotten around to it yet, cause it's hard work, and hard work's not my whole thing.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.300
Well, this is perfect. Two reckless dragons doing all the wrecking.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.300
I see.

19:11.300 --> 19:16.300
In that case, we can demolish anything you need, as long as we can continue to train here.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.300
Sure, works for me.

19:19.300 --> 19:23.300
Hmm. Sometimes things are not as we expect them to be.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.300
Let us resume.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.300
Hmm.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.300
Hmm.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.300
Ah!

19:35.300 --> 19:40.300
.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.300
Neighborhood Tangle class!

19:44.300 --> 19:45.300
So dumb!

19:46.300 --> 19:49.300
Just keep your eye out for name tags saying Jenny or Barry.

19:49.300 --> 20:08.300
Wow! You two don't need lessons! You're in perfect sync!

20:10.300 --> 20:12.300
No, we're not!

20:19.300 --> 20:39.300
I love Li... I love Li...

20:40.300 --> 20:42.300
That's the guy I told you about!

20:42.300 --> 20:51.300
Li's brainwashing him or something! We gotta get him out of here!

20:51.300 --> 20:52.300
No!

20:52.300 --> 20:55.300
You won't be doing that!

20:56.300 --> 20:58.300
Gotcha, fakers!

20:58.300 --> 21:03.300
Boy, howdy! You are some bad... bad neighbors!

21:03.300 --> 21:05.300
What is this, Li?

21:05.300 --> 21:12.300
Look, almost everyone in my land is a true, honest friend who is just happy to be here.

21:13.300 --> 21:23.300
But every once in a while, some no-good beatnik gets a harebrained idea that your old pal Li isn't on the up-and-up!

21:25.300 --> 21:31.300
Now, listen. Everything will make sense when you look at this flower.

21:31.300 --> 21:44.300
Soon you'll forget all your uncharitable ideas about Li, and we'll be best friends once again.
