00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
What is that?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.540
Or who is that?

00:13.580 --> 00:14.340
Kerr?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.780
I thought Thunderfeng ate all the Forbidden Five or something.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.360
Are we sure he didn't?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.080
Kerr looks not amazing.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.460
They're back!

00:25.760 --> 00:26.100
They?

00:30.000 --> 00:42.820
It's an attack!

00:42.960 --> 00:45.040
By what? I don't see anything.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.500
I told you, the invisible!

00:47.880 --> 00:49.900
We must push the blast somehow!

00:52.400 --> 00:56.920
It's kind of hard to smack someone in the face when you can't see their face!

01:00.000 --> 01:02.300
This is just like last night!

01:02.780 --> 01:04.880
I've never seen anything like this before.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.520
Put not intended now is not the time for jokes!

01:09.500 --> 01:12.580
Wait! I have seen something like this before!

01:14.640 --> 01:15.860
They're Dragonians?

01:16.400 --> 01:17.780
Invisible Dragonians?

01:17.900 --> 01:20.540
They look like the Soul Suckers from the Spectral Lands!

01:20.540 --> 01:29.620
They're draining their lives into that weird instrument!

01:29.620 --> 01:38.360
When I say duck, duck!

01:38.720 --> 01:40.440
My blade's made of prismatic steel!

01:40.820 --> 01:41.920
It should stop them!

01:42.580 --> 01:45.000
Kerring, win for the ducking!

01:45.000 --> 01:53.980
Oh, that's bad!

01:54.760 --> 01:56.820
Not only did my blade not destroy them,

01:57.120 --> 01:59.320
these things can break prismatic steel!

01:59.320 --> 02:29.120
When we get there, let me do all the talking!

02:29.320 --> 02:32.420
I don't need so-called ninja ruining my flow!

02:33.100 --> 02:33.400
Whoa!

02:36.280 --> 02:39.720
Did we hit something?

02:40.380 --> 02:40.940
No?

02:44.940 --> 02:46.600
Just Wildfire's driving.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.240
Weren't you supposed to practice flying this thing before we left?

02:50.620 --> 02:52.160
Aw, me, me, me, me, me!

02:52.160 --> 02:55.740
Weren't you supposed to not be so judgy about my driving?

02:56.000 --> 02:56.200
Huh!

02:56.480 --> 02:57.640
I'm the captain now!

02:57.880 --> 02:59.620
My ship, my rules!

02:59.880 --> 03:00.060
Huh?

03:02.060 --> 03:02.540
Ah!

03:03.220 --> 03:05.920
Can you just keep your eyes on the sky?

03:06.380 --> 03:06.860
Okay!

03:07.400 --> 03:09.700
How about your face to the sky?

03:09.940 --> 03:10.260
Ah!

03:10.260 --> 03:17.900
I've been to the administration before.

03:18.220 --> 03:20.400
Fine by me if you want to do all the talking, Jay.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.220
They'll probably fine me for not having a talking permit.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.280
How did you end up working there anyway?

03:25.540 --> 03:26.540
It's a long story.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.600
Or a short story.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.140
Who knows?

03:30.260 --> 03:32.400
I have zero memory of anything before the merge.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.980
We've told you what your life was like before the merge.

03:35.300 --> 03:35.560
Yeah!

03:35.920 --> 03:37.140
So did the administration.

03:37.620 --> 03:38.460
So did Roz.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.500
I now know not to believe any of you.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.760
But I do know this.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.140
My first memories?

03:44.500 --> 03:47.340
I found myself alone in the land of madness.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.060
Didn't even know my name.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.080
Then I spotted some nice young people in business suits,

03:52.260 --> 03:54.180
and I just had a feeling I could trust them.

03:54.340 --> 03:55.660
Because they were wearing suits?

03:55.980 --> 03:56.320
Yeah!

03:56.620 --> 03:57.740
So I went up to them,

03:57.900 --> 03:59.820
and it turns out they were looking for me.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.680
They told me my name was Jay Walker,

04:01.680 --> 04:03.840
and that I was an agent of the administration,

04:04.180 --> 04:05.120
just like them.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.640
How'd they know your name?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.940
How does the administration know anything?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.240
They said I'd worked there my whole life

04:11.240 --> 04:12.880
and had to get back to my job

04:12.880 --> 04:15.120
managing the Realm Reassignment Office.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.500
And you just believed them.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.680
Suits, Greenie.

04:19.340 --> 04:19.780
Suits.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.720
Turns out I was a natural,

04:23.920 --> 04:25.020
so it made sense.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.320
That's who I really was.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.340
So these suits claimed to know you?

04:31.680 --> 04:36.000
Uh, their boss did.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.400
Apparently the administrator sent them a message

04:38.400 --> 04:39.340
to go and get me.

04:39.820 --> 04:40.140
Ugh!

04:40.640 --> 04:40.940
Ugh!

04:43.840 --> 04:45.260
Who's the administrator?

04:45.680 --> 04:46.340
No clue.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.620
No one I talked to had ever actually seen him.

04:49.960 --> 04:50.620
Or her.

04:51.040 --> 04:51.780
Or them.

04:52.140 --> 04:53.040
Or it.

04:53.180 --> 04:54.200
Sounds creepy.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.660
So what did you actually do there?

04:57.420 --> 04:58.780
Realm Reassignment.

04:58.780 --> 04:59.920
You know this.

05:00.340 --> 05:03.380
People they'd find in empty space bubbles after the merge.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.720
My job was to send them back to wherever I thought they came from.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.540
Where you thought they came from?

05:08.880 --> 05:13.040
You, who has no memory of anything or anywhere from before the merge?

05:13.040 --> 05:13.740
Look out!

05:16.500 --> 05:19.840
I was working with the best information I could get.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.260
And sure, there might have been a few mix-ups, but there's no proof of that.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.580
And if there was proof, it would have been shredded and or burned.

05:26.820 --> 05:27.140
Ugh!

05:27.140 --> 05:30.740
Just a few mix-ups?

05:31.180 --> 05:33.800
You're famously terrible at guessing games.

05:34.020 --> 05:34.300
Hey!

05:34.880 --> 05:35.520
No lie!

05:35.740 --> 05:38.320
You tank every charades team you've ever been on.

05:38.460 --> 05:41.160
You expect me to believe I ever played charades?

05:41.420 --> 05:43.940
I don't even know what charades is.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.180
Yet you remember Aaron's parents?

05:46.640 --> 05:47.180
Of course!

05:47.540 --> 05:48.140
Jenny and Barry!

05:48.440 --> 05:51.040
I had to enter reassignment logs every night in triplicate.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.700
Then in the weekly reports, then the monthly reports, plus corporate memos.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.420
So that's how you know where they are now?

05:56.420 --> 05:57.740
Yeah, where I sent them.

05:58.060 --> 05:58.640
The Land of Li.

05:58.800 --> 06:03.660
Then why aren't we flying straight there instead of wasting our time at the administration?

06:07.760 --> 06:11.560
You can get to the location by air or boat.

06:11.800 --> 06:16.400
But the only way to get into the real Land of Li is through the Realm Reassignment Area.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.340
It won't make any sense until you experience it for yourselves.

06:19.660 --> 06:21.660
Oh, sounds dangerous.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.360
Now I'm excited!

06:23.840 --> 06:24.960
And we can trust you?

06:24.960 --> 06:27.220
You did shatter your goodness.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.320
You have no reason to trust me.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.480
But you don't have a choice, do you?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.400
Sold!

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
Let's go!

06:37.620 --> 06:38.700
What's with the cake?

06:38.860 --> 06:41.260
Let's just hope we don't have to use it.

06:41.260 --> 06:54.460
This is not our battle!

06:54.640 --> 06:56.040
These people need our help!

06:56.300 --> 07:00.320
The Pontifex Magicus has been hollowed and is of no use to me anymore!

07:00.540 --> 07:01.440
We're not leaving!

07:01.440 --> 07:08.960
Doug!

07:08.960 --> 07:09.020
Doug!

07:18.660 --> 07:21.080
Can't say I'm into fighting with a stubby blade!

07:21.400 --> 07:22.440
Where's the other half?

07:22.700 --> 07:22.980
What?

07:23.040 --> 07:23.780
You have some glue?

07:23.780 --> 07:38.840
Can you light this up?

07:39.040 --> 07:40.180
A brighter color?

07:40.640 --> 07:43.240
I think that might be a bit gaudy for the...

07:43.240 --> 07:44.900
No, illuminate it!

07:45.280 --> 07:46.760
Oh, light it up!

07:46.980 --> 07:48.480
Why didn't you say so?

07:50.800 --> 07:52.460
Could you use a coconut?

07:53.740 --> 07:55.600
No, I need light!

07:55.840 --> 07:56.500
Just asking?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.240
Some people like coconuts!

07:59.240 --> 08:00.240
Guess not you!

08:00.240 --> 08:08.520
There are way more of these things than I realized.

08:09.100 --> 08:09.660
Come on!

08:09.840 --> 08:10.500
This way!

08:10.700 --> 08:11.620
We must leave!

08:11.980 --> 08:14.480
The only reason we came here was to find the underworld!

08:14.980 --> 08:15.660
Oh, the underworld!

08:15.800 --> 08:17.140
I know exactly where that is.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.260
Well, not exactly, but I knew exactly where where math is, and that will tell me exactly.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.020
Where?

08:22.220 --> 08:22.700
Ninja!

08:23.100 --> 08:23.940
Protect this woman!

08:24.180 --> 08:25.580
She can help us on our quest!

08:25.840 --> 08:27.740
I can take care of myself!

08:30.240 --> 08:31.080
Anchor's way!

08:40.080 --> 08:41.080
Everyone alive?

08:41.780 --> 08:42.400
Not sure.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.700
I've never seen the administration from the outside.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.140
It's so...

08:54.940 --> 08:55.540
boring.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.200
I'm looking directly at it, and already forgot everything about it.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.300
So, how are we sneaking in?

09:03.560 --> 09:04.000
Air vents?

09:04.420 --> 09:04.760
Basements?

09:05.020 --> 09:06.740
Blast a giant hole, please!

09:07.260 --> 09:09.140
My instinct is a full attack.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.500
Sword slicing, taking out any and every agent that dares stand up to us.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.400
Show them what true power is.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.700
But there's too many of them, and that plan could fail.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.360
And that's not how ninja handle things.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.260
You really did shatter your goodness, didn't you?

09:26.460 --> 09:28.480
It's cute you think I had goodness to shatter.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.000
Nope.

09:30.380 --> 09:31.800
Straight-on attack won't work.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.180
So I got something better.

09:36.860 --> 09:37.380
Zoots!

09:37.540 --> 09:38.260
Am I right?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.640
Now watch this.

09:40.640 --> 09:54.320
Halt!

09:54.700 --> 09:55.240
Alan!

09:55.660 --> 09:56.520
Underwood!

09:56.700 --> 09:57.360
What's shaking?

09:57.860 --> 10:00.780
A little informal for a morning greeting.

10:01.620 --> 10:05.180
But it is casual Friday, so I'll allow it.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.720
Returning from sabbatical, Agent Jay Walker?

10:08.240 --> 10:08.480
Yep.

10:08.780 --> 10:13.680
And since today is Bring Your Ninja Warrior Friends to Work Day, I have companions heading

10:13.680 --> 10:17.060
to guest services to fill out their paperwork and get temporary badges.

10:17.520 --> 10:17.900
Hmm.

10:18.620 --> 10:22.160
Bring Your Ninja Warrior Friends to Work Day was last week.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.000
That escalated quickly.

10:25.780 --> 10:32.560
Uh, we must have just got the B-Y-N-W-F-T-W day wrong.

10:32.740 --> 10:35.900
That's not your most egregious offense, Agent Walker.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.600
You have long been on our most wanted list for abandoning your post.

10:43.000 --> 10:43.380
Ah!

10:47.380 --> 10:47.780
Ah!

10:50.320 --> 10:50.840
Ah!

10:50.840 --> 10:50.860
Ah!

10:52.160 --> 10:52.660
Ah!

10:52.660 --> 10:53.160
Ah!

10:53.160 --> 10:53.660
Ah!

10:53.660 --> 10:54.160
Ah!

10:54.160 --> 10:54.660
Ah!

10:54.660 --> 10:55.160
Ah!

10:55.160 --> 10:55.660
Ah!

10:55.660 --> 10:56.160
Ah!

10:56.160 --> 10:56.660
Ah!

10:56.660 --> 10:57.160
Ah!

10:57.160 --> 10:57.660
Ah!

10:57.660 --> 10:58.160
Ah!

10:58.160 --> 10:58.660
Ah!

10:58.660 --> 10:59.160
Ah!

10:59.160 --> 10:59.660
Ah!

10:59.660 --> 11:00.160
Ah!

11:00.160 --> 11:00.660
Ah!

11:00.660 --> 11:01.160
Ah!

11:01.160 --> 11:01.660
Ah!

11:01.660 --> 11:02.160
Ah!

11:02.160 --> 11:02.660
Ah!

11:02.660 --> 11:03.160
Ah!

11:03.160 --> 11:03.660
Ah!

11:03.660 --> 11:04.160
Ah!

11:04.160 --> 11:04.660
Ah!

11:04.660 --> 11:05.160
Ah!

11:05.160 --> 11:05.660
Ah!

11:05.660 --> 11:06.160
Ah!

11:06.160 --> 11:06.660
Ah!

11:06.660 --> 11:07.160
Ah!

11:07.160 --> 11:07.660
Ah!

11:07.660 --> 11:08.660
Ah!

11:08.660 --> 11:09.660
We must leave!

11:09.660 --> 11:12.660
It's the only way to keep you truly safe!

11:12.660 --> 11:13.660
Look at it, kitten!

11:13.660 --> 11:17.660
I'm going to protect this village with my last pop of magic if I must!

11:17.660 --> 11:18.660
Ah!

11:18.660 --> 11:19.660
Ah!

11:19.660 --> 11:20.660
Ah!

11:20.660 --> 11:21.660
Ah!

11:21.660 --> 11:22.160
Ah!

11:22.160 --> 11:22.660
Ah!

11:22.660 --> 11:23.660
Ah!

11:23.660 --> 11:24.660
Ah!

11:24.660 --> 11:25.160
Ah!

11:25.160 --> 11:26.160
Ah!

11:26.160 --> 11:40.160
What's happening?

11:40.460 --> 11:43.340
It's morning. They must not be able to stand the sun.

11:43.580 --> 11:50.080
I don't understand. It's like the Spectral Lands spread into this town, but only have power at night.

11:50.080 --> 11:54.980
Can these people be cured? Do we need to hunt down Kerr and return their life forces?

11:54.980 --> 12:02.620
Forget them. Our goal is to forge Source Dragon icons. And because of your choices, we failed.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.160
That's not our fault.

12:04.160 --> 12:08.660
It is your fault. Yours and the Source is a selfishness.

12:08.660 --> 12:15.000
Without her help, we're forced to find another way to the Underworld. If that's even possible.

12:17.740 --> 12:20.740
Cole and Zane said she lives in the monastery that appeared here.

12:20.740 --> 12:27.380
Maybe if we take her back home, we can help her get less hollowed out. And find her map to the Underworld.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.380
Sora, that's a great idea!

12:32.380 --> 12:34.920
Let us find this monastery.

12:34.920 --> 12:40.260
I can't believe you got us stuck in here. What kind of plan was that?

12:40.260 --> 12:46.900
This is just like you. You always had the weirdest, worst ideas, but usually they were charming somehow.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.900
This one is just plain stupid.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.900
Trust me. Everything is going exactly as planned.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.900
Don't see how that's possible.

12:53.900 --> 12:58.900
I knew the moment we entered the building, alarms would go off because I left the company, which no one ever does.

12:58.900 --> 13:03.820
Then we'd get sent here, deep into the inner workings, exactly where we need to be.

13:03.820 --> 13:05.460
In a cell with no escape.

13:05.460 --> 13:10.960
Yeah, it's perfect, because now the administration thinks they have us under their control.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.960
Now all we have to do is escape.

13:13.960 --> 13:19.340
Hey! Agent Etha! Yes! I'm talking to you!

13:19.340 --> 13:23.340
I know you don't get much company in here.

13:23.340 --> 13:29.880
So, Agent Underwood told me you were really into Merlopian dance rituals and celebrations.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.180
Any interest in telling us more about that?

13:32.180 --> 13:36.320
I've been waiting for someone to ask me that my whole life.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.820
Dance ethnography is a really fascinating subject.

13:40.820 --> 13:46.320
In a show with them with exotic flowers, the town would elect a sacrifice.

13:46.320 --> 13:54.240
The lights would fade up and the lead dancer would descend with a fan and a lantern at the magical eel.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.740
You sure I'm not boring you?

13:57.740 --> 14:01.880
Anyway, the audience threw gummy candy on the stage.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.880
Shall I demonstrate?

14:03.880 --> 14:06.880
Ta-da!

14:06.880 --> 14:08.880
Eat the candy.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.380
That was informative, Etha.

14:12.380 --> 14:17.520
And doesn't their sacred winter dance involve a blindfold?

14:17.520 --> 14:20.520
I can't believe you know that!

14:20.520 --> 14:26.020
And I just so happen to have my dance blindfold with me for exactly this potential scenario.

14:26.020 --> 14:29.780
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

14:29.780 --> 14:34.020
Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

14:34.020 --> 14:37.440
I trust her's still there and enjoying this silently.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.440
She's a fantastic dancer!

14:40.440 --> 14:41.200
Be right back!

14:41.200 --> 14:42.940
Need something from the locker room!

14:42.940 --> 14:44.740
What could you need from a locker room?

14:44.740 --> 14:47.180
It's where Agent Leopold keeps his gym shorts.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.500
I'm gonna need more information.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.800
He never washes them.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.500
Yaw!

14:59.500 --> 15:00.500
Brian!

15:10.500 --> 15:12.500
What is that?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.500
That smells like Agent Leopold.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
Oh!

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
Call the detox crew!

15:24.500 --> 15:26.500
Oh, I should learn Merlopia dances!

15:31.500 --> 15:32.500
It wasn't me.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.500
Why did you come along?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.500
All you do is mess things up!

15:35.500 --> 15:36.500
You can't drive, right?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.500
You dance into alarms!

15:38.500 --> 15:39.500
You bored ninja!

15:39.500 --> 15:43.500
But it's not bring your ninja warrior friends to work day!

15:43.500 --> 15:45.500
Those are the same ninja!

15:45.500 --> 15:46.500
And jaywalker!

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
They flew the coop!

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
Curse you, Agent Leopold!

15:55.500 --> 15:56.500
Oh, it's dead!

15:56.500 --> 15:58.500
It's... in my lungs!

15:58.500 --> 16:11.500
I think the sorceress is coming too! She sees her home!

16:12.500 --> 16:15.500
Uh... maybe it'll get better inside?

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
Some kind of security!

16:16.500 --> 16:17.500
This shouldn't be a problem!

16:17.500 --> 16:18.500
Oh!

16:18.500 --> 16:19.500
I hope you enjoy my traps!

16:19.500 --> 16:20.500
That's what you get for trying to break in, whoever you are!

16:20.500 --> 16:21.500
Predictable as always!

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
Janet!

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
Who's Janet?

16:23.500 --> 16:24.500
Who's Janet?

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
We're almost around reassignment!

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
We'll be safe as soon as...

16:26.500 --> 16:27.500
Oh!

16:27.500 --> 16:28.500
Oh!

16:28.500 --> 16:29.500
Oh!

16:29.500 --> 16:30.500
Oh!

16:30.500 --> 16:31.500
Oh!

16:31.500 --> 16:32.500
Oh!

16:32.500 --> 16:33.500
Oh!

16:33.500 --> 16:34.500
Oh!

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
Oh!

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
Oh!

16:36.500 --> 16:37.500
Oh!

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
Oh!

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
Oh!

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
Oh!

16:40.500 --> 16:41.500
Oh!

16:41.500 --> 16:42.500
Oh!

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
Oh!

16:43.500 --> 16:44.500
Oh!

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
Oh!

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
Oh!

16:46.500 --> 16:47.500
Oh!

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
Oh!

16:48.500 --> 16:49.500
Oh!

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
Oh!

16:50.500 --> 16:51.500
And the tape as soon as...

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
Was this part of the plan?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.500
I didn't want to have to do this!

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
Green guy!

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
Cake me!

17:08.500 --> 17:09.500
Everybody!

17:09.500 --> 17:11.500
We've got an office birthday today!

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
And you've all got to sign this card!

17:13.500 --> 17:14.500
Ooh!

17:14.500 --> 17:15.500
A birthday!

17:15.500 --> 17:17.500
Leave some space for me!

17:17.500 --> 17:18.500
Put in a sign!

17:18.500 --> 17:19.500
Did you sign?

17:19.500 --> 17:22.500
Hey! We need plates! And maskets!

17:22.500 --> 17:24.000
Who's got plates and masks?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.500
Forks! Are there forks?

17:25.500 --> 17:26.500
I can grab them.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.500
He just has them.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.500
Come on! We need new clothes from Lost and Found!

17:37.500 --> 17:40.500
Do something! Use your elemental powers!

17:42.500 --> 17:44.500
There's no tech in this monastery!

17:44.500 --> 17:49.500
Wait a minute!

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
What are you doing?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
Casting a spell!

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
You don't know any spells!

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
Nope, but maybe we'll hit on something!

18:03.500 --> 18:05.500
Not that!

18:05.500 --> 18:07.500
Feels like we're getting closer?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.500
I'm not sure that's true.

18:09.500 --> 18:14.500
This is getting us nowhere!

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
No, but maybe these could get us somewhere.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.500
We can hold onto these fish and pull ourselves out!

18:21.500 --> 18:25.500
This now tops my weirdest things I've ever done list.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.500
The Unlocked Man!

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
This is the number one ever done list!

18:28.500 --> 18:29.500
Hmm.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.500
Uh!

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
Uh!

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
Ah!

18:33.500 --> 18:34.500
Uh!

18:34.500 --> 18:35.500
Uh!

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
Uh!

18:37.500 --> 18:38.500
Uh!

18:38.500 --> 18:39.500
Uh!

18:39.500 --> 18:40.500
Uh!

18:40.500 --> 18:42.500
Uh!

18:42.500 --> 18:43.500
Uh!

18:43.500 --> 18:44.500
Uh!

18:44.500 --> 18:45.500
Uh!

18:45.500 --> 18:46.500
Uh!

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
Uh!

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
Uh!

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
Uh!

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
Uh!

18:50.500 --> 18:51.500
Uh!

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
Uh!

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
Uh!

18:53.500 --> 18:54.500
Uh!

18:54.500 --> 18:56.500
The Underworld.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
Why?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
Told you, the land of Lee is weird,

19:06.500 --> 19:09.500
and you definitely can't parade in there dressed like a ninja.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
Ha-ha! Still got it!

19:23.500 --> 19:24.500
Oh, one more thing.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.500
For some reason,

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
everyone who got lost in the space bubbles were mostly a pair.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
Like siblings, couples, whatever.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
We need fake stories like that!

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
If we're going undercover,

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500
Wild Fart, you and I are brother and sister.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.500
Barf!

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
And Jay and Nia are married.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
Gross, but okay.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
Everybody ready?

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
There they are!

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
Let's shut down the system!

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
No!

20:08.500 --> 20:09.500
Wildfire!

20:10.500 --> 20:11.500
No!

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
Leave her! The portal's closing!

20:16.500 --> 20:19.500
You might have shattered your goodness, but we didn't!

20:19.500 --> 20:20.500
Ah!

20:21.500 --> 20:22.500
Ah!

20:22.500 --> 20:23.500
Ah!

20:23.500 --> 20:24.500
Ah!

20:24.500 --> 20:25.500
Ah!

20:25.500 --> 20:26.500
Ah!

20:27.500 --> 20:28.500
Ah!

20:29.500 --> 20:30.500
Ah!

20:31.500 --> 20:32.500
Ah!

20:32.500 --> 20:33.500
They've escaped!

20:33.500 --> 20:34.500
Ah!

20:34.500 --> 20:35.500
Ah!

20:36.500 --> 20:38.500
Ah!

20:38.500 --> 20:39.220
Custard.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.400
What is this now?

20:45.740 --> 20:49.600
Appears and feels unauthorized.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.500
Hope she'll be okay.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.540
We're gonna have to come back and try to save her in that town.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.160
What is he doing?

21:12.540 --> 21:14.460
I have no idea.

21:18.540 --> 21:21.280
Yes, Master. It will be done.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.880
Oh, hey, Roz. The sorceress is settled in.

21:30.140 --> 21:32.060
As safe as can be, I guess.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.320
I do not care about her well-being.

21:34.740 --> 21:36.200
She has served her purpose.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.200
Now, to the underworld.
