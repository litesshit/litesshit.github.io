00:00.000 --> 00:21.840
X's! Get your vile, X's!

00:21.840 --> 00:24.800
Only three coins per pox!

00:25.180 --> 00:26.380
Only three coins?

00:26.580 --> 00:28.180
Oh, that's a dear and a half!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.420
Oh, wonderful!

00:33.480 --> 00:36.740
I'm so glad to be back in Abra-Colabria!

00:37.440 --> 00:40.200
You know, I haven't been here in years.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.560
Or has it been centuries? What time is it?

00:43.800 --> 00:45.200
One of the two.

00:47.020 --> 00:49.920
Hex's! Get your vile, X's!

00:50.020 --> 00:51.500
New X's? Check!

00:51.960 --> 00:56.640
Still need to visit the Slug Merchant, the Charm Boutique and the Slime Spa.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.860
But first...

00:58.860 --> 01:04.460
The Crystal Ball Repair Store!

01:07.280 --> 01:07.640
Hello?

01:08.360 --> 01:11.860
How much to get this old beauty patched up?

01:11.860 --> 01:22.240
Need some repairs, huh, lady?

01:22.600 --> 01:24.600
Oh, just some minor adjustments.

01:24.840 --> 01:29.120
You know, the poor dear isn't as young as she used to be.

01:29.120 --> 01:35.660
Adjustments? Come on! This thing's a total loss.

01:35.660 --> 01:44.880
Now, I could set you up with a brand new, top-of-the-line solid ruby model for half of what it would cost to repair this old junker.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.480
This Crystal Ball saved me when everything went down with the Carnus Conclave.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.080
I am not abandoning it now!

01:54.080 --> 02:03.680
You were around way back then? Whoa. Then you should definitely invest in some updated equipment. Check out this mob emerald number.

02:03.680 --> 02:09.280
What is that noise? Is it a sick troll?

02:09.280 --> 02:12.880
What is that noise? Is it a sick troll?

02:12.880 --> 02:22.480
I don't remember this town having such strange customs!

02:22.480 --> 02:35.080
Do I have to save the day yet again?

02:35.080 --> 02:40.580
Whoa! Told you it was a junker!

02:40.580 --> 02:44.180
How dare you insult her! She's one of the finest crystals from the-

02:44.180 --> 02:44.680
Ah!

02:44.680 --> 02:45.180
Ah!

02:45.180 --> 02:45.680
Ah!

02:45.680 --> 02:46.180
Ah!

02:46.180 --> 03:07.180
I was there, and it's still hard to explain. I saw Roz getting dragged into the portal gate.

03:07.180 --> 03:14.780
And since he was the only person who knew where my parents were, I freaked out. I couldn't lose him to the Forbidden Five.

03:14.780 --> 03:21.780
Then Noct made everything explode. And suddenly, I felt like my whole body was turning inside out.

03:21.780 --> 03:22.780
Ah!

03:22.780 --> 03:23.780
Ah!

03:23.780 --> 03:24.780
Ah!

03:24.780 --> 03:25.780
Ah!

03:25.780 --> 03:33.780
Then I landed somewhere I didn't recognize. The Forbidden Five were gone. But I had freed Roz.

03:33.780 --> 03:46.380
His injuries were really bad, and getting worse. He didn't have long to live. He would only tell me where my parents were if I took him to a place that could heal him. It wasn't close.

03:46.380 --> 04:04.380
While I dragged him along, he trained me. And my skills got better like never before. We finally made it to this creepy place called the Spectral Lands, where people who are departed pass through. It was some kind of healing elixir in a well. The only place you can get that stuff. Roz got better and kept his promise. I kinda wish he didn't. Roz made me another promise. He said if I helped him to undo the merge, I'd be better.

04:04.380 --> 04:11.380
To separate all the combined realms, he would be able to bring my parents back to life. So that's what we were trying to do when we ran into you and the ninja. I used my Objects Gunjitsu to destroy that big chaos dragon with some of that same elixir.

04:41.380 --> 04:45.880
I mean, I think it was my object Spinjitzu that did it. Unless...

04:45.880 --> 04:49.380
No, I didn't help with that. It was all you, Eren.

04:49.960 --> 04:54.480
So that's what you threw at the dragon. Healing juice from some strange well?

04:55.180 --> 04:57.500
We should probably stock up on that stuff.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.440
Yeah, it was not easy to get to.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.660
And there were these ugly things called soul suckers that attacked.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.620
And do you really trust that Roz isn't lying?

05:08.200 --> 05:12.440
I mean, what if reversing the merge can't bring your parents back like he says?

05:12.640 --> 05:15.020
I have to try because there's no other hope.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.580
If this doesn't work, my family is really gone.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.620
Hey, I get it. And that's why I'm here.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.800
Because if we're doing something dangerous, we're doing it together.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.340
We're a team, right?

05:29.660 --> 05:30.920
You bet we are.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.840
And remember, there's no Roz in team.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.060
Pack up. I know where we're headed.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.220
How? Some desert animal tell you?

05:40.680 --> 05:42.400
There's no one around for miles.

05:42.860 --> 05:46.800
You are with us by my permission, Sora. Do not test me.

05:47.140 --> 05:48.740
But she has a point, Roz.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.000
Even though it merged like all the other realms,

05:51.340 --> 05:53.520
I thought no one knew how to get to the underworld.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.320
It's all mystical and secret and stuff.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.920
It is. And I now know who holds those secrets.

06:00.920 --> 06:07.460
I wonder what the ninja are up to.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.140
Probably just another day at the monastery.

06:11.140 --> 06:21.060
Well, this speed is optimal for rapid travel.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.400
I feel we'd all be safer with better piloting.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.060
You try talking to her.

06:26.060 --> 06:29.040
My airship, my rules.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.900
And the rule is, I drive.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.680
Don't worry. I'll get us there in time.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.160
That wasn't my main worry.

06:39.540 --> 06:40.680
Who gave her an airship again?

06:40.940 --> 06:43.000
Roby, she saved his life.

06:43.340 --> 06:45.740
No one ever got me anything for saving their life.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.280
Oh, my cake's coming back up.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.060
I won.

06:49.060 --> 06:52.820
Oh, I told him not to eat cake for breakfast.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.520
Is it true?

07:02.280 --> 07:02.740
Yes.

07:03.760 --> 07:07.280
The great warrior will soon transition out of this life.

07:19.060 --> 07:25.800
Ninja, thank you for coming.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.520
Igalt, what can we do?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.120
There has to be something.

07:30.700 --> 07:36.860
Little one, you know the signs of late stage wasting sickness as well as I.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.600
There is nothing to be done.

07:39.600 --> 07:55.140
Members of my tribe, the dragons of the Northern Spiral are on the way to honor my passing.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.320
But they will not arrive in time.

07:59.320 --> 08:07.380
I am glad to see one last time with my mortal eyes, my final and greatest students.

08:07.380 --> 08:13.020
We wouldn't be the ninja we are today without the gift of your teachings, Master Igalt.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.800
It is you who gave me a gift.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.860
You restored my faith in people.

08:19.940 --> 08:23.920
It is a joy to have lived long enough to receive this gift.

08:25.260 --> 08:28.260
Where is my student, Aaron?

08:28.800 --> 08:34.740
Uh, Master, he and Sora have chosen to follow a different path.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.920
That hurts my heart.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.260
As a teacher, I was hardest on Aaron.

08:40.940 --> 08:45.400
Not because of his failings, but because he had the most potential of any ninja.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.840
The world needs that potential fulfilled.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.460
You cannot let him go astray.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.020
Master Lloyd.

08:56.020 --> 09:00.700
The stories my family told about you, I don't want them to end.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.320
All stories must end.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.080
But new ones begin.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.420
I will move along to the next stage of existence.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.660
Whatever that may be.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.180
A new adventure for an old dragon.

09:17.180 --> 09:21.600
You are a credit to the fire tribe, little one.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.840
A true dragon.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.420
You inspire me to be a great warrior.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.800
It is good to be a warrior.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.820
But one day you will make a great leader.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.040
Run to my companion of many centuries.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.680
The dangers we have faced.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.120
The life we have shared.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.500
As the seven source dragons are my witness.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.600
I would not change a moment of my time with you.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.200
Goodbye, my love.

09:56.200 --> 10:26.180
I would not change a moment of my time with you.

10:26.180 --> 10:35.660
You are thinking about Eren and Sora.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.120
Eagult was right.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.860
We have to find them.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.520
That is a very kind offer, Ryu.

10:45.260 --> 10:49.960
And I am sure living with you and the other dragons in the monastery would be delightful.

10:50.740 --> 10:53.260
But this has been my home for centuries.

10:53.260 --> 10:55.880
Eagult and I love these lands.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.120
I have to stay here.

10:58.120 --> 11:09.940
Farewell, young Ryu.

11:09.940 --> 11:19.700
Okay, let me just try to get this straight.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.120
The place we're going to is called Abracaduberdu.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.880
Abra-Calabria.

11:23.880 --> 11:28.160
Right, which apparently can lead us to the underworld where your source dragon icon forges.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.200
But until about three hours ago, you never said a word about it.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.160
Then you walk off for a couple minutes and come back with all kinds of answers.

11:34.580 --> 11:35.740
Are you just making this up?

11:35.980 --> 11:36.860
You can be honest with me.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.880
I do not need to be interrogated by the likes of you, Empyrean.

11:40.880 --> 11:45.360
Wow, pretty ungrateful for a guy riding on a cycle I totally built for him.

11:45.560 --> 11:49.480
I did not realize the price for these vehicles would be uninterrupted annoyance.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.420
Don't over-invite your value to me, Anna.

11:52.420 --> 12:03.620
If you see anything cool out there, you tell me right away.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.200
Because it's going to be boring without you.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.280
We promise to stay in contact.

12:08.580 --> 12:13.320
Ruby is allowing us to use this city of Temple's messenger dragons if the need to communicate arises.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.560
Hope those little dragons fly better than Wildfire and the Booty.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.520
I heard that, Mr. Barfy!

12:18.520 --> 12:23.460
I can think of no one more exciting to explore these new merged lands with, Zane.

12:23.700 --> 12:27.340
If you come across any other strange monasteries, let us know.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.360
We will.

12:28.980 --> 12:34.760
But the only parameters of this trip are for Pixel and I to share new and exciting experiences together.

12:39.780 --> 12:41.580
You two enjoy yourself!

12:48.520 --> 13:01.100
You said you were happy for Zane, but something tells me that wasn't the whole truth.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.740
Zane and Pixel deserve some space to themselves.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.840
It's just... I feel like we're falling apart.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.980
Master Wu always managed to keep us together.

13:10.460 --> 13:11.360
To unite us.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.540
And I... I don't have that ability.

13:14.980 --> 13:15.940
It's not your fault.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.380
The merge changed so many things, so dramatically.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.100
Yeah.

13:20.840 --> 13:24.200
Even when we find Missy Ninja, it's not the same.

13:24.460 --> 13:27.380
We've never had to help someone who shattered their goodness before.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.720
He's not only rude to me, but to Cole and Kai and everyone.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.460
But I can't lose faith in him.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.680
And right now, he's our best hope at bringing back Aaron and Sora.

13:38.680 --> 13:56.420
I'll prepare another recipe.

13:57.740 --> 14:02.280
I'm pretty certain his leg is healed and he's faking it now.

14:03.180 --> 14:05.780
I really hope he's leaving soon.

14:05.780 --> 14:13.780
Was it you two clowns who tried to beat my Gallimorph record?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.000
It was Kai, actually.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.780
He had this whole plan to lure you with that game

14:17.780 --> 14:19.880
because he knew it was your favorite when you were a ninja.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.480
Ugh, quit acting like you know me, liars.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.220
You could have heard about Gallimorph being my favorite game

14:26.220 --> 14:28.180
from anyone who's ever met me.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.180
We're not liars, Jay.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.720
We have pictures of us together when you were a ninja.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.300
You have a room here.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.720
The administration had pictures, too.

14:37.060 --> 14:40.900
And Roz told me all kinds of stories about me working for him.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.860
That stuff can be faked.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.480
You know what can't be faked?

14:44.940 --> 14:48.020
Me not trusting anyone but myself ever again.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.600
Well, I trust you.

14:49.860 --> 14:52.920
That's why I believe you when you say Aaron's parents are still alive.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.160
That's because they are.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.520
We need to find them and bring them back.

14:56.820 --> 14:57.640
Good luck with that.

14:57.740 --> 14:59.460
I told you they're in a really weird place.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.680
The realm of Li doubt you'd ever get close.

15:01.680 --> 15:05.480
But you could get us in?

15:05.980 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, right.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.140
I'm only here until my leg, which is definitely still massively injured, heals.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.860
Then I have to get back to my real job.

15:14.100 --> 15:19.160
I have someone paying me a small fortune to find that Roz guy your little buddy hangs out with.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.000
So money is all that matters to you now, Jay?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.280
Of course not.

15:23.820 --> 15:25.060
Video games matter, too.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.020
And drinking tea that's not terrible.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.800
Then we'll double what your other client's paying you.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.120
I'll get it.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.020
I can sell every scroll in the library if I have to.

15:36.280 --> 15:41.440
And once we find Aaron's parents, we need to find Roz, too, to get Aaron and Sora away from him.

15:41.660 --> 15:43.820
So you'll get money and our help.

15:44.180 --> 15:44.600
Hmm.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.880
And I can bring Roz back to my client?

15:48.260 --> 15:51.700
If we get Aaron and Sora back, you can do whatever you want with Roz.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.180
Fine.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.960
But I can only get three of you in the realm, Max.

15:58.060 --> 16:00.280
And one last thing, I'm in charge?

16:00.580 --> 16:00.840
Okay.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.020
None of this master ninja junk.

16:03.200 --> 16:03.400
Cool?

16:04.800 --> 16:05.240
Cool.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.440
What about your hurt leg?

16:10.120 --> 16:11.080
Miraculously healed.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.000
Okay, then.

16:12.100 --> 16:12.660
Time to prep.

16:12.780 --> 16:15.160
I'll need that frog guy to sharpen all my weapons.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.780
And do you know where there's a good dry cleaner?

16:35.240 --> 16:39.540
Hello, welcome strangers to Abra Calabria.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.980
Also, strangers are no longer welcome at Abra Calabria.

16:45.980 --> 16:55.660
I, Lord Roz of the Wildness, seek an audience with the Pontifex Magicus, who holds information that is most important to me.

16:55.660 --> 17:00.000
Maybe your homeland is too wild for my sensibilities, Lord.

17:00.360 --> 17:10.400
Because where I come from, which is this humble city right behind me, no longer welcome means that welcome you are no longer.

17:12.680 --> 17:16.460
Oh, now you've irritated Torex and Xerat.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.860
So go away.

17:18.220 --> 17:22.420
Last time the twins got angry, us wizards ended up in a hundred-year war.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.800
I found it most inconvenient.

17:25.660 --> 17:28.700
Yeah, Roz, I'm thinking maybe we better leave.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.340
No one denies me.

17:35.180 --> 17:35.880
Great.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.840
Just great.

17:55.660 --> 18:05.500
The Plateau was much lonelier than I imagined, so I am reconsidering your offer to come live here.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.820
But my loneliness is not the only reason.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.380
I once began your training to become a ninja, Ryu.

18:14.500 --> 18:18.300
And I am certain it would be Egot's wish for me to continue.

18:18.300 --> 18:30.820
Come on, we were trying to leave.

18:30.820 --> 18:35.720
Don't blame us for Roz's anger management issues.

18:35.720 --> 18:50.820
They must have been who attacked us last night.

18:50.820 --> 18:53.180
We were nowhere near here last night.

18:53.180 --> 19:09.980
I demand an audience with them.

19:09.980 --> 19:17.660
What curse is this?

19:17.660 --> 19:17.680
What curse is this?

19:19.500 --> 19:20.720
Please, come on.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.160
What happened here?

19:28.160 --> 19:30.600
Is this why they didn't want to let us in?

19:30.600 --> 19:32.520
You!

19:32.520 --> 19:34.680
Where is the Pontifex Magicus?

19:34.680 --> 19:37.560
He alone can direct me to the underworld.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.160
You want the Pontifex?

19:39.160 --> 19:40.200
There he is!

19:40.200 --> 19:45.380
What has befallen this village?

19:46.660 --> 19:50.560
If you just listened to me, this whole situation could have been spared.

19:50.560 --> 19:57.220
But no one listens to me anymore, not since that head-shrinking incident in the year 45 AL.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.980
What are you talking about?

19:59.340 --> 20:04.340
Well, I thought I had a spell for normal-sized heads, but boy, was I wrong.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.000
No!

20:05.200 --> 20:06.780
What happened to the villagers?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.000
Oh, that.

20:08.180 --> 20:09.420
We were attacked!

20:09.420 --> 20:12.300
How do we know they aren't the ones who attacked us?

20:12.300 --> 20:13.300
Yeah!

20:13.300 --> 20:14.300
Yeah!

20:14.300 --> 20:15.800
Yeah, explain yourself!

20:15.800 --> 20:16.340
Wait a minute!

20:16.340 --> 20:16.840
Aaron!

20:16.840 --> 20:17.840
Sora!

20:17.840 --> 20:18.840
Sorceress!

20:18.840 --> 20:20.840
It's been so long!

20:20.840 --> 20:23.840
I've already seen the villagers.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.840
They are ninja, and the ninja are allies.

20:27.840 --> 20:33.840
Although, I've never met that one, and you do look like a little angry cat-man.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.840
You should try to smile more.

20:35.840 --> 20:41.100
Sorceress, I'm assuming this place isn't always like this?

20:41.100 --> 20:42.980
Oh, goodness, no!

20:42.980 --> 20:43.980
Oh, goodness, no!

20:43.980 --> 20:50.520
Last night, at the precise moment the sun set, we heard these super-crippy noises, and then

20:50.520 --> 20:53.520
we were attacked by invisible enemies!

20:53.520 --> 20:54.980
How did you defeat them?

20:54.980 --> 20:56.980
Well, we didn't.

20:56.980 --> 21:03.860
When the sun came up, they were gone, and the victims now walk around like in living sleep.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.400
One attacker almost got me.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.400
My ball blew.

21:08.400 --> 21:14.540
For a second, I felt like something was trying to suck out my life force, but I managed to

21:14.540 --> 21:15.600
get away.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.680
Invisible creatures sucking life.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.980
Maybe those soul-suckers you told me about.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.640
But they can't leave the spectral lands.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.220
What did these creepy noises you heard sound like?

21:26.220 --> 21:31.220
Like that.

21:31.220 --> 21:44.220
They've come back to finish the job.

21:44.420 --> 21:48.800
Go, go, go.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.060
Go!

21:55.060 --> 21:59.340
Any questions?

21:59.340 --> 22:02.400
Ready?

22:02.400 --> 22:02.900
Happy days.

22:02.900 --> 22:11.420
Maybe you will.
